## Quick Reference for Submission Form

### Title
```
Building a Production-Ready Hotel Billing System with AI-Assisted Development and AWS
```

### Description / Summary (150-200 words)
```
Learn how I built a high-performance hotel billing management system in just 5 days using AI-assisted development with Kiro, Next.js, and AWS-compatible infrastructure. This comprehensive guide walks through the entire development journey—from requirements gathering to production deployment—achieving sub-second response times and Amazon-level user experience.

Discover practical techniques for optimizing database performance, implementing real-time order tracking, and building scalable multi-tenant applications. The project demonstrates how AI-assisted development can reduce development time by 75% while maintaining high code quality and security standards.

Key highlights include: optimistic locking for concurrent updates, connection pooling strategies for cloud databases, instant UI feedback mechanisms, and comprehensive testing with property-based tests. Whether you're a full-stack developer, cloud architect, or startup founder, this post provides actionable insights and production-ready code you can use in your own projects.

Complete source code available on GitHub with detailed documentation and deployment guides.
